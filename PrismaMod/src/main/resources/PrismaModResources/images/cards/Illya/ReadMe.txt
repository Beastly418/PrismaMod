Install Cards are the powers

Other class cards are just going to be weaker versions of the powers and less rare than the class cards

Devil, maid, gun, astolfo are all meme cards.

Zwei will be a 1 turn kill or you die gives you like 15 energy and like 30 STR will just deal like 1000 damage to you afterwords

Testament will be an "alter" card that will be an card draw and energy alter

Shirou the bear will be a wall card, that whole alter will be a defensive alter
